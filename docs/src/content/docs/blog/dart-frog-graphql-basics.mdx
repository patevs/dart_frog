While Dart Frog doesn't provide an “out of the box” way to implement a GraphQL
schema, in this blog we'll walk through how to build a GraphQL server powered by
Dart Frog with just a few additional Dart packages.

:::note

The goal of this guide is not to discuss the pros and cons of using GraphQL over
REST or other protocols. This guide is focused on illustrating one way to
implement a GraphQL server powered by Dart Frog.

:::

## Getting Started

To get started, simply create a dart frog server as you would normally would
using the `dart_frog create` command.

Once you have a project, add two dependencies from [pub.dev](https://pub.dev).

- [`graphql_schema2`](https://pub.dev/packages/graphql_schema2)
- [`graphql_server2`](https://pub.dev/packages/graphql_server2)

```sh
dart pub add graphql_schema2
dart pub add graphql_server2
```

The `graphql_schema2` package will be used to create the schema and
`graphql_server2` will transform the schema into a server, or in our case, a
route in our Dart Frog server.

Next, we need to create the schema. Consider this hypothetical API:

> The Cool Games API is a GraphQL server that provides a way to query cool games
> for cool people to download.

Our example schema is composed of an entity called game, that has three fields,
`id`, `name`, `downloadLink`.

We can model that entity with the following plain Dart class:

```dart
class Game {
  const Game({
    required this.id,
    required this.name,
    required this.downloadLink,
  });

  final int id;
  final String name;
  final String downloadLink;
}
```

We can then describe that model in a GraphQL schema:

```dart
GraphQLObjectType createGameSchema(
  RequestContext context,
) {
  final gameType = objectType(
    'game',
    fields: [
      field('id', graphQLInt, resolve: (obj, args) => (obj as Game).id),
      field(
        'name',
        graphQLString,
        resolve: (obj, args) => (obj as Game).name,
      ),
      field(
        'downloadLink',
        graphQLString,
        resolve: (obj, args) => (obj as Game).downloadLink,
      ),
    ],
  );
  return gameType;
}
```

Next, we need to create a full schema that includes the queries we will expose
from our server.

Let's write a repository that we can use to query games:

```dart
class GameRepository {
  Future<List<Game>> fetchGames() async => _games;

  Future<Game?> fetchGameById(int id) async {
    final result = _games.where((game) => game.id == id);
    if (result.isEmpty) return null;
    return result.first;
  }
}

const _games = [
  Game(
    id: 1,
    name: 'Mine Cat Digger',
    downloadLink: 'https://g4me.info/catdigger',
  ),
  Game(
    id: 2,
    name: 'Pixelado',
    downloadLink: 'https://g4me.info/pixelado',
  ),
];
```

:::tip

Don't forget to provide the repository to our context using
[dependency injection](https://dart-frog.dev/basics/dependency-injection).

:::

The code to create the queries would look something like:

```dart
GraphQL createGraphQL(RequestContext context) {
  final gameSchema = createGameSchema(context);

  final schema = graphQLSchema(
    queryType: objectType(
      'Query',
      fields: [
        field(
          'games',
          listOf(gameSchema),
          resolve: (_, __) =>
            context.read<GameRepository>()
              .fetchGames(),
        ),
        field(
          'findGame',
          gameSchema,
          inputs: [
            GraphQLFieldInput('id', graphQLInt),
          ],
          resolve: (_, args) =>
            context.read<GameRepository>().fetchGameById(
              args['id'] as int,
            ),
        ),
      ],
    ),
  );

  return GraphQL(schema);
}
```

Finally, we need to expose this via a route. Let's create a `graphql.dart` route
in our server with the following code:

```dart
Future<Response> onRequest(RequestContext context) async {
  if (context.request.method != HttpMethod.post) {
    return Response(statusCode: 405);
  }

  final queryJson = await context.request.json();

  if (queryJson is! Map<String, dynamic> || !queryJson.containsKey('query')) {
    return Response(statusCode: 400, body: 'Missing "query" field in JSON.');
  }

  final query = queryJson['query'] as String;
  final variables = queryJson['variables'] as Map<String, dynamic>?;

  final graphQL = createGraphQL(context);
  final data = await graphQL.parseAndExecute(
    query,
    variableValues: variables ?? {},
  );

  return Response.json(body: {'data': data as Map<String, dynamic>});
}
```

And that's all there is to it! You can now query your server for games using
GraphQL:

```bash
$ curl http://localhost:8080/graphql \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -X POST \
  -d '{ "query": " query AllGames() { games() { id name downloadLink } } "}'
```

The above query should produce the following response:

```json
{
	"data": {
		"games": [
			{
				"id": "1",
				"name": "Mine Cat Digger",
				"downloadLink": "https://g4me.info/catdigger"
			},
			{
				"id": "2",
				"name": "Pixelado",
				"downloadLink": "https://g4me.info/pixelado"
			}
		]
	}
}
```
